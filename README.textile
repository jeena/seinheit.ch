Katharsis Framework is a lightweight open-source MVC-framework for PHP5.

Its principles of project processing as well as its handling are based on the manners of Zend Framework, so it is the perfect tool for a programmer who is looking for a lightweight alternative to Zend Framework.

Katharsis Framework is written in native, object-orientated PHP5 code only. It keeps things simple without bloating your project unnecessarily.
